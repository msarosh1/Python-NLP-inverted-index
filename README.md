# Semester-5-Work
Implementing an Inverted Index on Html files
This project was part of an assignment for my 5th semester during BSCS.
It was part of one of the my favorite subjects; Information Retrieval.
It includes some basic data manipulation, and the core concepts of natural language processing. The code is pretty self explanatory.
